# Task Instructions

Your task is to run the project and implement the **Edit** and **Delete** functionalities for products on the product page.

- **Create a new page/component for editing a product.**  
- Since this is a frontend-only project, you can use mock data to simulate product updates and deletions.
- The **Edit** functionality should allow modifying product details and updating the local state.
- The **Delete** functionality should remove the product from the displayed list.

Focus on code quality, user experience, and maintainability. Make sure the interactions are smooth and intuitive.

Good luck, and do your best!
